/**
 * TODO: Profile Management Feature (Future Work)
 *
 * Overview:
 * This section outlines the intended plan for implementing a "Shared Profiles" feature
 * within the app. This allows users to save and reuse common test configurations.
 *
 * Feature Goals:
 * - Let users create, edit, and delete named profiles.
 * - Each profile represents a full test configuration (same fields as RunTestFragment).
 * - Users can quickly load a profile to pre-fill the Run Test form.
 *
 * Components Needed:
 * 1. data class IperfProfile:
 *    Holds server IP, port, duration, bandwidth, interval, etc., with a profile name.
 *
 * 2. ProfileManager (singleton/helper):
 *    Manages saving and loading profiles using SharedPreferences (JSON per profile).
 *
 * 3. ProfilesFragment:
 *    - Displays list of saved profiles (RecyclerView)
 *    - Supports add, edit, delete actions
 *    - Clicking a profile loads it into RunTestFragment
 *
 * 4. AddEditProfileDialog or Fragment:
 *    - Reuses same input fields as RunTestFragment
 *    - Used for both creating and editing profiles
 *
 * 5. Integration with RunTestFragment:
 *    - Add `loadProfile(profile: IperfProfile)` method to populate fields
 *    - May use a shared ViewModel or navigation arguments for passing profile data
 *
 * Storage Strategy:
 * - SharedPreferences with each profile stored as JSON under a unique key (e.g., "profile_<name>")
 * - Alternatively, store all profiles as a single JSON array if easier to manage
 *
 * Optional Enhancements:
 * - Export/import profiles
 * - Auto-sync with cloud (e.g., Firebase or Google Drive)
 * - Validate IP/port inputs before saving
 *
 * Reason for Deferral:
 * This feature is planned but not implemented yet. Leaving this as a placeholder for
 * future developers picking up this project to implement based on this roadmap.
