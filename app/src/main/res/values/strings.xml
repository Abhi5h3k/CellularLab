    <string name="info_ip">Enter the server\'s IP address or hostname (e.g., 192.168.1.1).</string>

    <string name="info_protocol">
    Choose the protocol to use for the test:\n\n
    • TCP — Reliable protocol for throughput measurement with acknowledgments and congestion control. Ideal for stable links.\n\n
    • UDP — Lightweight protocol for speed testing without acknowledgments. Simulates real-time traffic like video or voice. Requires manual bandwidth setting.\n\n
    • UDP Incremental Ramp-Up Test — 📈 Gradually increases UDP bandwidth by 50 Mbps per iteration until the defined target is reached. Helps evaluate how performance scales under increasing load.\n\n
    • TCP + UDP Hybrid Strategy — 🔄 Runs an initial TCP test to estimate maximum bandwidth, then uses that result to configure UDP bandwidth automatically. Combines accuracy with high-speed testing.\n\n
    • Smart Ramp-Up Strategy — 🤖 Dynamically adjusts UDP bandwidth based on actual performance in previous iterations. Increases bandwidth only if at least 90% of the current step was achieved, ensuring adaptive scaling.\n\n
    ✅ Recommended: Use Hybrid or Smart Ramp-Up for optimized and automated test planning.

    <string name="info_duration">Duration in seconds for how long the test should run.\n\nExample: 60</string>
    <string name="info_bandwidth">Set the bandwidth (in Mbps) for UDP tests.\n\nExample: 100</string>
    <string name="info_parallel_streams">Number of parallel streams used during the test.\n\nExample: 1</string>
    <string name="info_interval">Time interval in seconds for each report during the test.\n\nExample: 1</string>
    <string name="info_test_direction">
    Choose the direction of the test:\n\n
    • Upload — 📤 Sends data from your device to the server. Useful for testing outbound bandwidth and upstream performance.\n\n
    • Download (-R) — 📥 Server sends data to your device. Tests inbound bandwidth and download performance. Uses the `-R` (reverse) flag.\n\n
    • Bidirectional (--bidir) — 🔁 Performs both upload and download tests simultaneously. Gives a complete view of network performance. Uses the `--bidir` option.\n\n
    💡 Tip: Use Bidirectional to quickly assess both upload and download throughput in one go.

    <string name="info_iterations">Number of times to repeat the test.\n\nExample: 3</string>
    <string name="info_wait_time">Wait time in seconds between repeated test iterations.\n\nExample: 15</string>
    <string name="info_options">
    • 🐛 Debug — Enables technical logs for troubleshooting.\n\n
    • 📋 Verbose — Enables detailed per-second output from iPerf.\n\n
    • 📉 Auto Reduce Bandwidth on Packet Loss —\n\nDuring UDP tests, this option monitors for high packet loss.\n\nIf a threshold is reached, a dialog will appear suggesting to reduce bandwidth.\n\nBy default, it will auto-accept after 5 seconds to help improve stability.
